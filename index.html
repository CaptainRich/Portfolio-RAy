        <div class-"flex-row">
            <h2 class="section-title primary-border">Who I Am</h2>

            <p>
                I am an Engineer by education.  After undergraduate school I worked for an EPC firm (rebuilding a port in Guiaquil, Ecuador).  After several years at the EPC firm I joined a Consulting Engineering firm specializing in Offshort Arctic Structures.  The projects at this firm consistently required specialized software development dealing with the dynamics of structures and floating bodies.  While at this Consulting firm, an associate convinced me to join his company, developing Engineering Software - specifically Piping and Pressure Vessel Stress Analysis software.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been with this firm for 35 years, working my way up to partner/owner before we sold to a larger corporation.  My position requires the not only software planning, development, and maintenance - but also the supervision of the technical staff, acquisition plans, business plans, technical support, documentation, training, and presentations.
