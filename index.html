            <img src="assets/images/rich.jpg" alt="Rich's photo"></img>
    
            <p>
                I am an Engineer by education. After undergraduate school I worked for an EPC firm (rebuilding a port in
                Guiaquil, Ecuador). After several years at the EPC firm I joined a Consulting Engineering firm
                specializing in Offshore Arctic Structures. The projects at this firm consistently required specialized
                software development dealing with the dynamics of structures and floating bodies. While at this
                Consulting firm, an associate convinced me to join his company, developing Engineering Software -
                specifically Piping and Pressure Vessel Stress Analysis software.  These Engineering applications perform their computations according to national and international codes and standards (such as B31.1, B31.3, EN-13480, API-650, ASCE #7 and ASME Section VIII Division 1).
            </p>
    
            <p>
                I have been with this firm for 35 years, working my way up to partner-owner before we sold to a larger
                corporation. My position requires not only software planning, development, and maintenance - but
                also the supervision of the technical staff, acquisition plans, business plans, technical support,
                documentation, training, and presentations.  Software development efforts involved various technologies and languages (Assembly, Fortran, C, C++, HTML, CSS, and Javascript). I also led the (multi-year) effort to bring our existing QA program up to NQA-1 standards, resulting in acceptance in all subsequent industry audits.
